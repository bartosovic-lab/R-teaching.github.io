   - MMSE --> Mini Mental State Examination
   - CDR --> Clinical Dementia Rating
   - eTIV --> Estimated total intracranial volume
   - nWBV --> Normalize Whole Brain Volume
   - ASF --> Atlas Scaling Factor



## Import the dataset 

```{r}
mmse <- read.csv(file='../Data/alzheimer.csv',header = TRUE,comment.char = '#')
```

------

## Data exploration 

Q1: How many rows and columns does the dataset have ? 
Q1.1 What are the names of the columns ? 

Q2: Which of the columns are ordinal and which are categorical ? 

Q3: Are there any missing values in the dataset ?

Q4.2: How many Demented/Nondemented are there in the dataset ? 

Q5: What is the mean age overall ? 

Q5.1 What is the mean age of demented group ? 

Q5.2 What is the mean age of nondemented group ? 

Q5.3 What is the mean age of demented males group ? 

Q6: What is the minimum and maximum value of MMSE score ? 

-----

## Visualisation

Q7: Plot a boxplot of mmse score in demented vs non-demented individuals using either base plotting or ggplot

Q7.1: Add jitterplot of individual observations into the boxplot.

-----

## Statistical analysis

Q8: Does the MMSE column follow normal distribution ? Check with QQ-plot and Shapiro-Wilk test.
