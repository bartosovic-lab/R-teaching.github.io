# KN7001 Neurochemistry with Molecular Neurobiology

R is a **free** and **open-source** programming language frequently used for **data science, statistical analysis, and data visualization**. Whether you are working with small or large datasets, R offers powerful tools for processing and analyzing data.

R is versatile and can be applied to a wide range of tasks—from **plotting** a few data points to performing advanced analyses on **transcriptomic** and **genomic data**. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate basic usage of R for **data analysis, statistics, and visualization**.

One of R's strengths comes from its vast ecosystem of **packages** (or libraries) written by the R community. These packages make many data analysis and visualization tasks easier. Additionally, R has an active **community** and numerous forums where you can find solutions to common issues or ask questions about specific problems.

## Interface

Data analysis in R is typically done in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). The most widely used IDE for R is RStudio, which can be downloaded here: [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/).

## Notebook 1: Importing the data and basics

### Example: Statistical Analysis of Neurite Outgrowth

Neurites are any type of projection/process from the cell body of a neuron and can be differentiated into either dendrites or axons. In this experiment, we measured neurite outgrowth in cell cultures after two different treatments with differentiation factors, along with a control group. The measurements were taken using an automated analysis pipeline, and the results were exported into a CSV file.

We will go through the steps of importing the data, performing basic quality control (QC), visualizing it, and test the data for statistical significance.

In this tutorial:
- Instructions are provided as regular text.
- Code is shown inside grey boxes, which you can copy and paste directly into your RStudio session.

**Note:** Some code blocks might require minor edits based on your file paths or environment.

```{r}
# Lines that start with "#" are comments in R. These lines are ignored when the code is executed.
```

### Import the CSV file into R

Before we can analyze the data, we need to import it into R and store it in the computer's memory (RAM). Once imported, we can manipulate, clean, visualize, and perform statistical analysis on the data.

#### Steps to Get Started


1. **Organize your project:**
   - Create an empty folder on your desktop (or any preferred location) and name it `statistical_analysis_R`.
   - Inside this folder, create two subfolders:
     - `notebooks`: to store your R scripts.
     - `data`: where you will store the CSV file you just downloaded.

**Note:** General rule for data analysis is to keep the data and code/notebooks separated in different folders.

2. **Download the data:**
   Download the  data file from the GitHub repository by clicking the [link](https://github.com/bartosovic-lab/R-teaching.github.io/tree/main/data). Download all 3 files in the folder by clicking the file and pressing download in upper right corner. 


#### Import the CSV file into R

To import data from a CSV file, we typically use the `read.csv()` function in R. The data will be stored in an object (a variable in R) called `neurites`.

The `<-` operator in R is used to assign the output of the `read.csv()` function to the `neurites` object.


Now, use the following code to load the data into the `neurites` object. Make sure to replace the file path with the correct path to where you saved the CSV file.

**Note:** It is also possible to import the data to Rstudio using the `Import dataset` button, but it's not recommended as a good practice. For reproducibility it's better to use written code (it's impossible to record what was done by clicking buttons).

```{r}
# Load the data into the 'neurites' object.
# Replace the file path below with the actual path to your CSV file.

# In order to find out what folder you are working use function getwd()
getwd()
```

```{r}
# In my case the working directory is 
# "/Users/marek/SU drive/Teaching/2024/statistical analysis in R/notebooks"

# The data is in directory:
# "/Users/marek/SU drive/Teaching/2024/statistical analysis in R/Data"

# Therefore I will use this command to load the data: 
neurites <- read.csv(file = "/Users/marek/SU drive/Teaching/2024/statistical analysis in R/Data/03_neurites_synthetic.csv")

# Tip: If you’re unsure of the file path, use the getwd() function in R to check your current working directory.
# Tip: Use the <TAB> key for auto-completion of file paths in RStudio.
```

Once the data is imported, we can inspect the first few rows of the dataset using the `head()` function to ensure everything was loaded correctly:


```{r}
head(neurites)
```

Alternatively, you can view the entire dataset in a tabular format using View() (works well for smaller datasets). This will open a new tab in your scripts viewer. 

```{r}
View(neurites)
```


#### Checking the Data Structure:

To find out how many rows and columns the dataset contains, you can use the following functions:


```{r}
# Number of rows
nrow(neurites)

# Number of columns
ncol(neurites)

# Dimensions (both rows and columns)
dim(neurites)

```

By default, the data imported using `read.csv()` is stored as a data frame in R. We can confirm this with the `class()` function.


Other classes include vectors, matrix etc. 

```{r}
class(neurites)
```


#### Data Types in R

In R, data can be of several types:

   - Integer (whole numbers, e.g., 1, 2, 100)
   - Numeric (real numbers, e.g., 1.5, 22.6)
   - Character (text strings, e.g., "cat", "hello")
   - Logical (Boolean values: TRUE, FALSE)

In a data frame, each column can contain data of a different type. Let’s check the data types in our dataset by extracting each column using the `$` operator. The columns in our dataset are "control", "condition_1", and "condition_2" (as we previously saw using `head()` function)


```{r}
# Display the first few values from the 'control' column
head(neurites$control)

# Check the data type of the 'control' column
class(neurites$control)

```

Repeat this for the other columns:

```{r}
head(neurites$condition_1)
head(neurites$condition_2)

class(neurites$condition_1)
class(neurites$condition_2)
```

All 3 individual columns of our data frame are numeric vectors

-----

#### Loading data from Excel

You can also load data directly from Excel files using the `readxl` package. However, frequent shuffling between Excel and R is not recommended for large datasets.


```{r}
library('readxl')

excel_data <- as.data.frame(read_excel('../Data/excel_data.xlsx',sheet = 1, skip = 4))
excel_data

# If the 'readxl' package isn't installed, use the command below to install it:
# install.packages('readxl')
```


-----

### Calculate Descriptive Statistics

Since all the columns in our dataset are numeric, we can calculate descriptive statistics such as the **mean**, **standard deviation**, **quantiles**, and **median**.

We can use the `summary()` function to display a quick summary of the data, including common statistics like minimum, maximum, and median values.


```{r}
summary(neurites)
```

Let’s calculate specific statistics for the **control** group:

```{r}
mean(neurites$control)
sd(neurites$control)
quantile(neurites$control, 0.25)
quantile(neurites$control, 0.75)
median(neurites$control)
```

You can also calculate statistics for other columns by replacing `neurites$control` with `neurites$condition_1` or `neurites$condition_2`.

```{r}
# Your code here
```

-----

### Basic Arithmetic in R

We can also perform arithmetic operations on the data. For example, let’s calculate the fold change between the average neurite outgrowth for `condition_1` and the `control` group.



```{r}
# What is the average fold and log fold change between control and condition_1 ? 
# Calculate fold change
fch <- mean(neurites$condition_1) / mean(neurites$control)
print(fch)

# Calculate log2 fold change
log2fch <- log2(fch)
print(log2fch)

# Chaining functions together in one line
log2(mean(neurites$condition_1) / mean(neurites$control))

```

You can compare the control group’s neurite lengths to the mean or quantile values like this:

```{r}
# Compare control observations with the mean of all controls
neurites$control > mean(neurites$control)
```

-----

#### Advanced Data Frame Manipulations

In many cases, we need to work with specific subsets of data or reformat the dataset. Below are examples of how to index and manipulate data in R.

```{r}
# Index by rows - row 3
neurites[3,]

# Index by rows - row 1-5
neurites[1:5,]

# Index by columns - column 1
neurites[,1]

# Index by columns - column 1 and 2
neurites[,1:2]
neurites[,c(1,2)]

# Index with TRUE/FALSE vector
neurites[,c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE)]

# First row and first column
neurites[1,1]

# We can also index based on value being >=< then, for example:

neurites$control > 0.5
neurites[neurites$control > 0.5,] # Shows only rows in which control value > 0.5, note we also filter the condition_1 and condition_2 columns
```

-----

### Categorical variables

```{r}
# For categoric variables, we can't do arithmetics, but can easily summarize the data
# Let's create a fake vector with categoric variable

colors <- c('red','blue','blue','green','red','blue','yellow','red','orange','green','purple','grey','orange')

# Categorical variables in R are called factors
# Convert the vector to a factor
colors <- as.factor(colors)
colors

# Function table counts how many times do we have each categorical variable in our vector
table(colors)

# We can also categorise continuous variables, for example using greater or less then as cutoff
# How many neurites are longer than the average in control sample ?
table(neurites$control > mean(neurites$control))

# How many neurites are longer than 90% quantile of neurites distribution ? 
table(neurites$control > quantile(neurites$control,0.9))


```

##### *Exercise1:* 

Write code that prints the `mean`, `standard deviation`, and `20th and 80th quantiles` for both `condition_1` and `condition_2` in the neurites dataset.

```{r, code="'\n\n\n\n'", results=F}
```
