# Data import from excel

```{r data_loading}

# Load the library first to read excel spreadsheet
library(readxl)

# Skip first 4 lines to get nicely organised data frame with column names
# If the data frame still looks messy, try changing parameters to load the data to end up with table such as below

# If the whole import went well, the data frame should look like the one below: 
```

# Calculate the average of CPM counts

```{r}
# Use function rowMeans to calculate mean of CPM_rep1 and CPM_rep2
competitive$mean_CPM <- rowMeans(competitive[,c('CPM_rep1','CPM_rep2')])

```


# Plot the data in dose-response plots and in log scale

```{r plot_data}
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)


# Plot the mean CPM counts on y axis against the concentration

# The measurements span several orders of magnitudes of concentrations, and in such case it's better to log10 transform the concentration to better capture the response in binding to the concentration
# Let's do this in a ggplot graph by adding scale_x_log10() layer

ggplot(data=competitive,aes(x=conc,y=mean_CPM)) + geom_point() +  geom_line() + scale_x_log10()

# Model the saturation binding using dose-response curves

The formula we use is a 4-parameter logistic regression model (4PL) in a shape of sigmoid curve.

![**Figure1** Formula we use for fitting of the 4PL model](./dose_response_equation.png)

### The 4 parameters are:

-   top - predicted maximum value of response (plateau)
-   bottom - predicted minimum value of response
-   EC50/IC50 - concentration when the response is at 50%
-   h - hill slope - defines the steepness of the sigmoid curve

### The measured variables are:

-   Dose (X) - concentration of the ligand [conc]
-   Response (Y) - CPM value [mean_CPM]

For more details on dose-response analysis see [here](https://www.graphpad.com/support/faq/how-do-i-perform-a-dose-response-experiment/)

```{r model}
# Formula from image 1 written for CPM_rep1 measurement
formula = mean_CPM ~ bottom + (top-bottom) / (1+ 10^((log10(EC50)-log10(conc))*h))

# In order to initialise the model we can guess-timate the parameters from the curves
# For model1 and CPM_rep1 measurements this could be:
EC50 = 1e-8
top  = 800
bottom = 0
h = -1        # -1 because sigmoid is going down / +1 if the response was going up

# After initialising the parameters we can try to fit the model specified by formula with the actual measurements
model   <- nls(formula,data=competitive,start=list(EC50=EC50,h=h,top=top,bottom=bottom))
summary(model)
```

Note that summary(model) prints out the estimated parameters for the sigmoid curve.

Perform sanity check that the values of bottom, top and EC50 roughly correspond to the expected values.This can be done graphically as follows:

```{r}
predicted_bottom <- coef(model)['bottom']
predicted_top    <- coef(model)['top']
predicted_EC50   <- coef(model)['EC50']

# Plot the data points as before, but this time we add the values of bottom, top and EC50 as horizontal/vertial lines
ggplot(data=competitive,aes(x=conc,y=mean_CPM)) + 
  geom_point() +  
  geom_line() + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = predicted_bottom,col='red',linetype='dashed') +
  geom_hline(yintercept = predicted_top,col='blue',linetype='dashed') + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = predicted_EC50,col='grey60',linetype='dashed')


```



# Calculate predicted values from the model along whole range of measurements

```{r}
# Specify range for which we want to make prediction - from half of minimum value to double the maximum value
min_conc = min(competitive$conc) / 2
max_conc = max(competitive$conc) * 2

# Generate vector of values in between minimum nad maximum on a log scale
pred_conc    <- 10^seq(from=log10(min_conc), to= log10(max_conc), length.out=200)
head(pred_conc)

# Predict tha data using model obtained in previous block
pred_data      <- data.frame('conc' =pred_conc, 'replicate' = 'CPM_rep1')
pred_data$pred <- predict(model,pred_data)
```

# Plot the data and the predictions together

```{r}
# Plot the dose-response measurements and the fitted curves together in a single plot
ggplot() + 
  geom_line(data=pred_data,aes(x=conc,y=pred)) + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  geom_point(data=competitive,aes(x=conc,y=mean_CPM)) + 
  ggtitle(paste0('predicted EC50 = ', predicted_EC50)) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = predicted_EC50,linetype='dashed',col='grey60')

```




```{r}
cat('EC50 is: ',predicted_EC50,'\n')


```
